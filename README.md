# RayScenes

A library adding an easy way to do scenes for raylib(or really anything)!

Single header, just copy `src/rayscenes.cpp` to your project, and rename it to `rayscenes.hpp`.
You can also just copy `src/rayscenes.cpp` to your source folder and `include/rayscenes.hpp` to your header folder and link the .cpp separately.

Written in for C++20, should support C++17.
